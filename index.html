            1. In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of
            his
            robe filled the temple.
          </p>

            2. Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces,
            with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
          </p>
          <p class="section__paragraph--white">
            3. And they were calling to one another:
            ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty;
            the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="section__paragraph--white">
            4. At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.

            5. ‚ÄúWoe to me!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúI am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean
            lips,
            and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.‚Äù

            had taken with tongs from the altar.</p>
          <p class="section__paragraph--white">
            7. With it he touched my mouth and said, ‚ÄúSee, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your
